# A Text-based Desktop Environment
_aka Monotty Desktop_ [#desktopio](https://twitter.com/desktopio)

Monotty Desktop is a cross-platform, full-featured desktop environment.  
A user interface where by all output is presented in the form of text.  
  
The first biggest advantage of this desktop environment concept that it can be used directly over SSH connections, no additional protocol needed.  
The second is the flexible multi-user interface that serves several users engaged in collaborative applications and enables users to view a collaborating userâ€™s workspace.
